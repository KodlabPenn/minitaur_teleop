# Minitaur remote control with ROS

This package is based on the [Ghost Robotics SDK](http://ghostrobotics.gitlab.io/SDK/). See the `CommandOverEthernet` example in the SDK to properly setup the ROS bridge over Ethernet.

## Usage
Once the ROS bridge has been setup and running, launch `minitaur_teleop.launch` to control the robot. Here we assume that an Xbox-360 controller is used.
